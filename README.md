## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

First of all upgrade pip using command.

-->pip install --upgrade pip

-->sudo pip install keras

 If you are using a virtualenv, you may want to avoid using sudo:

-->pip install keras

                                    Configuring your Keras backend
                            By default, Keras will use TensorFlow as its  
                            tensor manipulation library. Follow these instructions 
                                    to configure the Keras backend.

2.Install Pandas.
